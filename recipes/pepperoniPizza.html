    <h1>A homemade pepperoni pizza recipe</h1>

    <img src="../images/pepperoniPizza.jpg" alt="A delicious pepperoni pizza">

    <p>Homemade pepperoni pizza is a satisfying blend of crispy crust, zesty tomato 
        sauce, melted cheese, and spicy pepperoni slices. Making it at home allows 
        for complete control over every layer, from hand stretched dough to the 
        thickness of the sauce and the amount of cheese. The pepperoni crisps up as 
        it bakes, releasing oils that blend with the bubbling mozzarella to create 
        that classic pizzeria flavor right from your own oven.</p>

    <p>What makes homemade pepperoni pizza special is the flexibility to tailor it 
        exactly to your liking. Whether you prefer a thin, crunchy base or a thick, 
        chewy crust, a light sprinkle of cheese or an extra layer, every pizza can 
        be customized. Fresh herbs, garlic, or a drizzle of olive oil can add even 
        more depth, turning a simple dish into a personal favorite. It's comfort 
        food at its finest, simple, satisfying, and always a crowd pleaser.</p>
